# Barrettâ€™s dotfiles

This is originally based on [mathias's dotfiles](mathiasbynens/dotfiles), and is an eternal work in progress.

## Installation

There is a main bootstrap script (`bootstrap.sh`) that does all the bootstrapping. You pass it options as follows:

```bash
./bootstrap.sh -b -f -h -o -l -t -v
```

Any or many of the options can be passed in. The options are as follows:

```
* -b = bash shell
* -f = fish shell
* -h = Homebrew
* -o = OSX (and Homebrew)
* -l = linux
* -t = tmux
* -v = vim
```

### Installing a fresh Mac

This will install general dotfiles, fish, vim, tmux, OSX things.

* Setup an SSH key with GitHub
* Clone the dotfiles into `/usr/local/dotfiles`
  _ First change the owner of `/usr/local` to your user
  _ The first time you run the `git` command it will ask to install the command line tools. No need to install Xcode!
* Install LastPass in Safari
* Bootstrap ALLTHETHINGS `/usr/local/dotfiles/bootstrap.sh -votf [NAME]` \* I have started using wine varieties for computer names
* Install App Store purchases

### Linux Setup

I also use a Linux box from time to time, so here is how I bootstrap that puppy:

```bash
./bootstrap_linux.sh
```

### Linux From Scratch

On a brand new Linux install you probably won't have `git` installed, and may not even have `sudo` installed.

#### [Install Sudo](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/425664)

Enable su-mode:

```
su -
```

Install sudo:

```
apt-get install sudo -y
```

Enable sudo for your user:

```
usermod -aG sudo yourusername
```

Finally, you need to log out and log back in.

#### Run Installer Script

Now you can run the installer script from GitHub. Trust me, it's fiiiiine.

```
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/barrettclark/dotfiles/master/bootstrap_linux.sh | bash
```
